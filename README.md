# Decentralized Small-Scale Fishery Management

A blockchain-based platform empowering coastal communities to sustainably manage local fisheries through transparent catch reporting, collaborative resource monitoring, and direct market access.

## Overview

This project addresses the challenges faced by small-scale fisheries worldwide through a decentralized approach to fishery management. By creating a transparent system for fisher registration, catch reporting, sustainability monitoring, and direct market access, the platform helps protect marine resources while supporting the livelihoods of coastal communities.

The system uses smart contracts to create a trustworthy record of fishing activities that can be verified by regulators, consumers, and conservation organizations while giving small-scale fishers more agency in resource management and market access.

## Core Components

### 1. Fisher Registration Contract

Records and verifies small-scale fishing operations:
- Fisher identification and credentials
- Vessel specifications and capacity
- Fishing gear types and methods
- Operational areas and jurisdictions
- Traditional/indigenous fishing rights
- Licensing and compliance verification

### 2. Catch Reporting Contract

Creates transparent records of harvesting activities:
- Species identification and quantities
- Catch location and time data
- Fishing effort metrics
- Bycatch documentation
- Size and maturity statistics
- Fishing conditions and observations

### 3. Sustainability Monitoring Contract

Assesses fish populations and establishes sustainable limits:
- Collaborative stock assessments
- Seasonal catch limits by species
- Fishing area rotation schemes
- Spawning ground protection
- Marine ecosystem health indicators
- Adaptive management triggers

### 4. Direct-to-Consumer Contract

Facilitates connections between fishers and local markets:
- Catch availability notifications
- Transparent pricing and traceability
- Quality verification
- Delivery coordination
- Consumer feedback mechanisms
- Community-supported fishery arrangements

## Benefits

- **For Fishers**: Provides verified market access, fair pricing, reduced middlemen, participation in management, and documented sustainable practices
- **For Communities**: Ensures food security, preserves traditional livelihoods, supports local economies, and maintains cultural fishing heritage
- **For Marine Ecosystems**: Promotes sustainable harvesting, prevents overfishing, supports data-driven management, and enables rapid adaptation to changes

## Technical Implementation

- Built on [specify blockchain platform]
- Smart contracts written in [programming language]
- Mobile-first design for on-vessel reporting
- Offline capabilities for at-sea operation
- GPS and camera integration for verification
- Language localization for fishing communities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [List technical prerequisites]

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fishery-management.git

# Install dependencies
cd fishery-management
npm install
```

### Configuration
1. Configure your blockchain connection in `config.js`
2. Set up regional species databases
3. Configure sustainability parameters for your region

### Deployment
```bash
# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to test network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network testnet

# Run tests
npx hardhat test
```

## Usage Examples

### Registering a Fisher
```javascript
// Example code for fisher registration
const fisherRegistry = await FisherRegistry.deploy();
await fisherRegistry.registerFisher(
  "0x123...", // Fisher wallet address
  "Small Trawler", // Vessel type
  vesselSpecifications, // Detailed vessel information
  gearTypes, // Array of fishing methods
  operationalAreas, // Approved fishing zones
  licenseVerification // Regulatory approval hash
);
```

### Reporting a Catch
```javascript
// Example code for catch reporting
const catchReporter = await CatchReporter.deploy();
const catchId = await catchReporter.reportCatch(
  fisherId,
  [
    {species: "cod", quantity: 25, averageSize: 45},
    {species: "haddock", quantity: 10, averageSize: 38}
  ],
  catchLocation,
  timestamp,
  fishingEffort,
  waterConditions,
  "ipfs://QmX..." // Documentation images hash
);
```

## Field-Specific Features

- **Offline reporting**: Records catches at sea without connectivity
- **Species identification assistance**: Visual guides and AI support
- **Simplified data entry**: Quick-input options for common species
- **Catch verification**: Optional third-party verification process
- **Weather integration**: Automatic weather data incorporation
- **Traditional knowledge**: Option to record ecological observations

## Implementation Roadmap

- **Q2 2025**: Initial platform development with pilot fishing community
- **Q3 2025**: Mobile app development and ocean-specific field testing
- **Q4 2025**: Integration with existing fishery management systems
- **Q1 2026**: Expansion to additional regions and species databases

## Stakeholder Ecosystem
